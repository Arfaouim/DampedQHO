OVERVIEW
========

This repository provides a simple numerical model of a damped quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The numerical background for the model of the QHO may be found freely online in Chapter 5 of R. Bertlmann's notes [1]. The author has extended Dr. Bertlmann's work into a to a phenomenological model of an environmentally-damped using the Lindblad equation. This was initially used to study vibration-assisted electron transfer in molecular computing devices [2].
